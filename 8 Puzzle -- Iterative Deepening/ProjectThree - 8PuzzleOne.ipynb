The purpose is to put the squares in the correct order only by sliding the squares next to the gap.)\n\n<img src=\"img/sol05.gif\">\n\n# Introduction:\nIn this project we were meant to find a solution to a given 8 puzzle using iterative deepening. This project is very similar to my Missionaries and Cannibals solution, as they both use essentially the same tree file. \n\n# Discussion Of Solution:\nThis project wasn't a huge amount of work, as I was able to take my solution to the previous project and just apply it to this one. It's almost the same kind of solution too, I have a tree that makes a node for every possible legal move. \n\nThe class for the nodes is a bit more extensive than the one I made for the previous projects."

Its parents and its children\n\nI'm hoping this isn't what makes it way more sluggish than the previous project, but I will discuss that later. \n\nTo make sure it doesn't make any bad or unnecessary moves, I have 2 ways of checking. The first is that the board is surrounded by -1s, so if the blank space tries to swap with anything outside the bounds, it ends that node. Like this:\n\n-1,-1,-1,-1,-1\n\n-1, 1, 2, 3, -1\n\n-1, 3, 4, 5, -1\n\n-1, 6, 7, 8, -1\n\n-1,-1,-1,-1,-1\n\nThe second check is here:\n"

      "source": "This runs through each nodes parents all the way back to the root node, and if it's at the same step as one of its parents then it ends the node.\n\nThis is also likely a spot where it slows the program down, as it keeps having to go through all the parent's data for each node. If I have time to improve on this, I might try using a dictionary to hold the previous values, but delete all the previous nodes. I'm not sure if it would work but it's just a thought. \n\n\n# Testing Design and Expected Results\n\nFor the output of my program, when it gets to around 15 layers deep, it starts to really slow down. It has to go through each node and make around 4 more, so the number of nodes is almost quadrupling every level. The number of nodes gets super high and slows the program down significantly. If it takes less than 10 moves to solve the puzzle, then it should find it within a few seconds. \n\nI think one of the main reasons why this program creates so many nodes is because, unlike the missionaries and cannibals, it has so many moves it can make that. Even if it the moves are technically legal, it might not even be in the correct direction, so it ends up creating a lot of unnecessary paths that bog up the program. "

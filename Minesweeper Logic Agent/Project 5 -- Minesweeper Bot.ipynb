Each square may contain nothing, a mine, or a number that indicates the number of mines next to that square. You need to reveal all the squares that aren't mines, and flag all the ones that are. It is a pretty straightforward game, but it is difficult if you don't know what's going on. I still have yet to win a game of minesweeper by myself. "

It keeps track of the number of blank or flagged squares next to it (A square is 2 with only two blank squares, then both of those blanks are mines.), it will flag blank squares, and it will click all the number squares afterwards(because this reveals more blank squares)\n\nThis part has 2 main drawbacks, \n    1. It looks ugly and it's hard to read. There's so much going on in there that I get lost half the time while reading it.\n    2. It's what bogs the rest of the program down. I know that there is an easier and quicker way to do this, which I'll talk about later, but this is the way I did it for now. The biggest problem is that I need to do this for each number tile, and each loop has 3 other loops inside it (Most of them go for less than 8 iterations, but still, it adds up), so that really adds on the runtime.    \n    \nOne last thing, it decides what to click in 2 different ways. The first is that it flags definite mines and clicks around it, revealing more squares. The second way is that it calculates what it belives to be the least risky square to click, which I could do a better job at calculating, because it still hits mines sometimes. I also read online that the best first move to make is to click the four corners of the board, but I'm beginning to believe that's not true, because it still manages to hit a large number of mines in the corners.

It's not a significant difference, but it is a difference. I think this method would work best if it kept track of how many were revealed by a corner click. Like, if it only revealed a single number, then it would click another corner, but if it revealed a lot of the board, then maybe it just wouldn't click the corners. This or the 5th solution where you click in the middle would be the better solutions.\n\nI'm happy it was able to solve the 9x9, but the amount of times it lost by clicking on a mine in the corner was too many, and that's a part that I need to fix. Along with how it determines which is the safest square to click on, because that's most of the reason why it was able to come close 3 times, but lose right at the end, because it misjudged which square was the mine. Overall though, not the worst bot I've ever made though! I'll try to make it more efficient when I have the time, and when I do I'll either update it here or put it on my github (Or Both)(https://github.com/NotEnoughMilk)"

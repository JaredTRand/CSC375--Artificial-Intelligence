The vacuum cleaner would start in a random position in the room, along with a number of squares that are randomly become dirty based on a given probability. The vacuum runs for a given number of steps each time the program is run and cleans as many dirty spaces as it can reach. The performance of an agent is calculated by dividing the amount of dirt cleaned by the amount dirt total. The measure for each agent is found by running the simulation 200 times for each dirt probability (10%, 20%, 30%) and averaging the resultss.\n\n\nThe agents we were meant to make are seen below:\n\n- Simple (deterministic) reflex agent (just sense, act, sense, act), the agent has a dirt sensor and a bump sensor. It can clean, turn (left or right), and move forward.\n\n- Simple (random) reflex agent, as above but can take a random action.\n\n- A reflex agent which is deterministic but can remember the last 4 sensor inputs and last 4 actions."

It's not really surprising that this is the order that they came out in, as the simple agent just moves in a direction until it hits a wall and then just circles the border until the program stops. What was a little surprising is how close the random and table driven agent's results are to each other. I should've expected them to be close seeing as how, while the random agent moves around randomly, the table driven agent only moves around slightly less randomly so it kind of makes sense why they are so similar.
